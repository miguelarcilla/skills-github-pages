On-demand requests and operations that can be triggered by user interactions with the UI, such as data model queries generated by report visuals, are classified as interactive operations. They're usually triggered by user interactions with the UI. For example, an interactive operation is triggered when a user opens a report or selects a slicer in a Power BI report. Interactive operations can also be triggered without interacting with the UI, for example when using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a custom application to run a DAX query.
